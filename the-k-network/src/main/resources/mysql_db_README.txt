For remote mysql development env, create a local mysql db.

Name the schema knetwork

Create a user, knet_user with password of password

The app in dev mode will create the tables necessary for you.


OTHERWISE, TO SKIP MESSING WITH MYSQL:

Leave everything as is, an embedded Derby db will be used.
